JEE Main 2021 Paper With Solution Maths Feb 24 Shift 1

h = (at2+a)/2, k = (2at+0)/2

⇒ t2 =(2h-a)/a and t=k/a

⇒ k2/a2 =(2h-a)/a

⇒ Locus of (h, k) is y2 = a (2x – a)

⇒ y2 = 2a(x- a/2)

Its directrix is x - a/2 = -a/2

⇒ x = 0

Question 4: A man is walking on a straight line. The arithmetic mean of the reciprocals of the intercepts of this line on the coordinate axes is 1/4. Three stones A, B and C are placed at the points (1,1),(2,2), and (4,4) respectively. Then which of these stones is/are on the path of the man?

a. B only
b. A only
c. the three
d. C only
Solution:

Answer: (a)

x/a + y/b = 1

h/a + k/b = 1 ⋯⋯(1)

and (1/a + 1/b)/2 = 1/4

∴1/a + 1/b = 1/2 ⋯⋯(2)

(From (1) and (2))

Line passes through fixed point B(2, 2)

Question 5: The statement among the following that is a tautology is:

a. A∧(A∨B)
b. B→[A∧(A→B)]
c. A∨(A∧B)
d. [A∧(A→B)]→B
Solution:

Answer: (d)

A∧ (~ A∨B)→B

= [(A∧~A)∨(A∧B)]→ B

= (A∧ B)→ B

= ~ (A∧B)∨B

Question 6: Let f :R→R be defined as f(x) = 2x-1 and g:R - {1} →R be defined as g(x) = (x-½)/(x-1).

Then the composition function f(g(x)) is:

a. Both one-one and onto
b. onto but not one-one
c. Neither one-one nor onto
d. one-one but not onto
Solution:

Answer: (d)

f(g(x)) = 2g(x) - 1

= 2(x - 1/2)/(x - 1) - 1

= x/(x - 1)

f(g(x)) = 1 + 1/(x - 1)



∴ one-one, into

b. discontinuous at all integral values of x except at x = 1
c. continuous only at x = 1
d. continuous for every real x
Solution:

Answer: (d)

Doubtful points are x = n, n∈I

f(n) = 0

Hence continuous.

Question 8: The function f(x) = (4x3- 3x2)/6 - 2sin x + (2x - 1)cos x:

a. increases in [1/2, ∞)
b. decreases (-∞, 1/2]
c. increases in (-∞, 1/2]
d. decreases [1/2, ∞)
Solution:

Answer: (a)

f’(x) = (2x - 1) (x - sin x )

⇒ f'x ≥ 0 in x∈(-∞, 0] ⋃ [1/2, ∞)

and f'x ≤ 0 in x∈(0, ½)

Question 9: The distance of the point (1, 1, 9) from the point of intersection of the line (x - 3)/1 = (y - 4)/2 = (z - 5)/2 and the plane x + y + z = 17 is:

a. √38
b. 19√2
c. 2√19
d. 38
Solution:

Answer: (a)

(x - 3)/1 = (y - 4)/2 = (z - 5)/2 = λ

x = λ + 3, y = 2λ+ 4, z = 2λ+5

Which lies on given plane hence

⇒ λ+3+2λ +4+2λ+5 = 17

⇒ λ = 5/5 = 1

Hence, point of intersection is Q (4, 6, 7)

∴ Required distance =PQ

= √(9+25+4)

= √38

Question 12: If the tangent to the curve y = x3 at the point P(t, t3) meets the curve again at Q, then the ordinate of the point which divides PQ internally in the ratio 1:2 is:

a. –2t3
b. –t3
c. 0
d. 2t3
Solution:

Answer: (a)

Equation of tangent at P(t, t3)

(y - t3) = 3t2(x - t) ⋯(1)

Now solve the above equation with

y = x3 ⋯(2)

By (1) & (2)

x3 – t3 = 3t2 (x - t)

x2 + xt + t2 = 3t2

x2 + xt – 2t2 = 0

⇒(x – t)(x + 2t) = 0

⇒x = - 2t

⇒Q(-2t, -8t3)

Ordinate of required point = (2t3 + (-8t)3)/3

= -2t3

Question 14: If ∫(cos x -sin x)/√(8-sin 2x) dx = a sin-1(sin x + cos x)/b + c where c is a constant of integration, then the ordered pair (a, b) is equal to:

a. (1, –3)
b. (1, 3)
c. (–1, 3)
d. (3, 1)
Solution:

Answer: (b)

Put sin x + cos x = t ⇒1 + sin 2x = t2

(cos x -sin x ) dx = dt

⇒I = ∫dt/√(8-(t2-1))

= ∫dt/(9-t2)

= sin-1 (t/3) + c = sin-1(sin x + cos x)/3 + c

⇒ a = 1 and b = 3
